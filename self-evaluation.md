# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
    - the `each` method can be used to call all elements in an array rather than typing the command for all individual elements out.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
    - I would say there is a lot more to learn (expecially on the official Ruby site) for Arrays like other methods and functions to use. 
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
    - Having a website directory for all the methods and their uses helped, but I had a problem with one my code that was ultimately solved when I looked to another student as an example.
